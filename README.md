ğŸ‘‹ Hi!

My name is Gary (never used Daniel to introduce myself, but I won't mind if you call me that as well). Currently thriving on my self-taught proces of being a full-stack web developer. I am also interested in diving deeper into cyber security as well. In my 2 years of programming experience I learned Python, Java, and C++ and I am still eager to learn more.
  - I am Philippine based! ğŸ‡µğŸ‡­
  - If you have any inquiries, feel free to contact me at ernogarydaniel@gmail.com ğŸ“§
  - I am open to collab in open-source and even personal projects! ğŸ¤—
